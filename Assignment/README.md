### Disclaimer

The dataset used in this project ([`pokemon.sql`](https://github.com/TurnipGuy30/Jupyter/tree/main/Assignment/pokemon.sql)) was not created by me. It is a slightly modified version of a file from [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/26b9357c6120d3d0d27c2b90c950e8c6) that I converted to `csv` format.
